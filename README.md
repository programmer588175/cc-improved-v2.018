# To do
Fix the website not working. It can load the page, but the game doesn't go past the loading screen.

Update about the website not working: It looks like it says "unexpected end of input" in the console. The line number it gave me was the last line, which was blank. So I removed it, but it added it again. WHAT SHOULD I DO?!
